I've always wanted a personal website, but struggled when it came time to design it. I've always said I can tell when something looks bad, but don't know how to fix it. I have finally settled on something I'm happy with. It took a lot of iteration and research, and I'm more confident in my design abilities as a result. Here's what I learned during the process.

## Purpose

Before opening Figma or thinking about colors and fonts, I defined what I'm trying to build. I want this site to accomplish the following four things:

- Improve online presence and personal brand
- Attract clients for freelance work
- Document my journey as a developer
- An additional asset in the job hunt

I don't intend for this to be a programming reference, Stackoverflow and CSS Tricks have that covered. I'll be sharing my experience as I figure out what it means to be a developer / lead / manager / director / CEO (ok, probably just developer ðŸ˜œ).

Sounds like I'll need a mashup of a blog and portfolio/resume site. With this in mind, I went to the internet to find inspiration.

## Borrow. Borrow. Borrow.

I looked at countless Dribbble shots and top 25 blogs to get a feel for what I wanted my site to look like. I discovered that I have an affinity for minimal and mobile first design which, asside from being common design patterns today, have the added benefit of taking less time to build. Here are a few of the my favorites.

## Time to Design

- Needed the following pages: home, menu, archive, blog post, about, contact, resume
- Mobile first design, even on desktop. Having a "hamburger menu" button on desktop is common
- Home page having one powerful statement about myself to intrigue the user, with the most important word highlighted in the accent color.
- Down arrow to scroll down the page is common.
- Using color as a repeated theme. Its pretty simple on this site, there are only two colors. Red is repeatedly used to indicate action.
- The logo with the red period is pretty good for branding I think.
- Font pairings

## Future Improvements

This site isn't perfect and I'm continuing to improve it all the time. Some things on the top of my list are:

- Case studies of the work I've done, portfolio section
- More content on the home page
- Subtle background image for a home page banner
- Link styling consistency
- Transitions / Effects
