I've always wanted a personal website, but struggled when it came time to design it. I've always said I can tell when something looks bad, but don't know how to fix it. I have finally settled on something I'm happy with. It took a lot of iteration and research, and I'm more confident in my design abilities as a result. Here's what I learned during the process.

## Purpose

Before opening Figma or thinking about colors and fonts, I defined what I'm trying to build. I want this site to accomplish the following four things:

- Improve online presence and personal brand
- Attract clients for freelance work
- Document my journey as a developer
- An additional asset in the job hunt

I don't intend for this to be a programming reference, Stackoverflow and CSS Tricks have that covered. I'll be sharing my experience as I figure out what it means to be a developer / lead / manager / director / CEO (ok, probably just developer ðŸ˜œ).

Sounds like I'll need a mashup of a blog and portfolio/resume site. With this in mind, I went to the internet to find inspiration.

## Borrow. Borrow. Borrow.

I looked at countless Dribbble shots and top 25 blogs to get a feel for what I wanted my site to look like. I discovered that I have an affinity for minimal and mobile first design which, asside from being common design patterns today, have the added benefit of taking less time to build. Here are a few of the my favorites.

## Time to Design

After being inspired and having a clear picture of what I was trying to build, it was time to open Figma and work through the details.

### Color

Color is difficult. I tried many different palletes from the internet and was even inspired by my [North Face Stormbreaker 3 Tent](https://www.rei.com/product/129203/the-north-face-stormbreak-3-tent). Nothing seemed to work. I learned that color is coupled to the layout and features of a site and you can't take *any* color pallete expect it to fit. This was the pitfall I ran into, I was trying to iron out the colors too early in the process. I waited until the layout was more established, only then realizing that I don't need more than two colors. The design is so minimal that forcing more than three colors into it made it feel akward. I ended up with a base color black and a red accent color. The accent color is used to draw attention to areas of focus and interaction. Two colors keep it minimal, focused on content, and easy to implement.

### Font

I tried using just one font for performance reasons, but that's too boring. A common pattern is to use font to differentiate headings and body text. I'm using Merriweather for the headings and Arial for body text. Arial is a system font, which is great because it doesn't need to be loaded over the network. Using system fonts is a great way to be performance focused, but not compromise design.

### Header

Instead of going down the rabbit hole of designing a logo, I opted to just have the text *"Tony."*. This is in the same font as the headings, and uses the accent color for the period. I feel this is as good as I can get without an actual logo, and establishes the brand / style / theme of the website in a concise way. As an aside, the favicon for the website follows a similar line of thinking. It is just the letter "T" followed by a period in the accent color.

There isn't anything too exciting going on with the menu, it uses the three bar icon everyone is used to. A common pattern is for the menu icon to transform into links on desktop, where there is more space. I opted to leave it an icon, which keeps the design simple and mobile first.

### Home Page



- Home page having one powerful statement about myself to intrigue the user, with the most important word highlighted in the accent color.
- Down arrow to scroll down the page is common.

## Future Improvements

This site isn't perfect and I'm continuing to improve it all the time. Some things on the top of my list are:

- Case studies of the work I've done, portfolio section
- More content on the home page
- Subtle background image for a home page banner
- Link styling consistency
- Transitions / Effects
