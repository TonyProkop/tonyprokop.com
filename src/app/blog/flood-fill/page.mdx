# An Interactive Guide to the Flood Fill Algorithm

The flood fill algorithm is a simple algorithm that is used to fill connected regions with a specific color. It is used in many applications, such as paint programs, image editing software, and games. In this article, we will explore the flood fill algorithm and implement it in JavaScript.

## What is the Flood Fill Algorithm?

The flood fill algorithm is a recursive algorithm that is used to fill connected regions with a specific color. It starts at a given point and fills all adjacent points that have the same color as the starting point. The algorithm continues to fill adjacent points until it reaches a boundary or a point with a different color.
